# instawork
A web interface for instawork

All the work is done in Django framework.

I have tried to demonstrate the use of custom forms and REST API with this project.

All the required packages for the working of the app is mentioned in requirements.txt file.

The app is made to work as a localhost app. 
The default port for the app is given as 8000. 
If there is any change for the port number, change the port numbers with respect to the new port number in the html page located at "instawork/instawork/instaworkapp/templates/index.html" as well.
